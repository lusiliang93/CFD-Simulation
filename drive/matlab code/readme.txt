There are three folders, final report.pdf  and Fluent files.zip 


——The three folders contain CRAC model, lid-driven cavity model and the animation of CRAC respectively.


---The CRAC folder consists of 12 .m files.

---The lid-driven cavity folder consists of 14 .m files.

---The Fluent_files.zip file contains CRAC and lid-driven files.


The steps to run both models are exactly the same.

---Step1: If you want to change the end time, then go to intial_all to change the variable of t; 
if you want to change the velocity, then also go to initial_all to change the variable u and v.

---Step2: Run the main.m file. 
For cavity model, after running the main.m, you will have a new video saved in the directory, either named as ‘surf.avi’ or ‘contour.avi’. 
For CRAC model, the video of two cases of airflow patterns from t=0 to t=30s have been saved. Therefore, there is no script to generate the video.


---To open Fluent files, please use ANSYS Workbench 16.0
