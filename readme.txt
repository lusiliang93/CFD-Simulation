# This is for mesh size of 128x128 and the domain is decomposed into 2x2 subdomain.
# When running this input file, the multiplication of node and processor has to be equal to 4:

# or
# ./run_latedays.sh 2 2 input.txt

# This is for mesh size of 128x128 and the domain is decomposed into 2x2 subdomain.
# When running this input file, the multiplication of node and processor has to be equal to 4:

# Attention: due to the code, the subdomain is limited to be square. Therefore, the total number of processor used has to be 1 or 4 or 16. 

# to run the plot matlab script to visualize the result, it requires matlab installed. 
# it also requires the post_outputu.txt and post_outputv.txt
